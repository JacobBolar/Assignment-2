    <p>Make corrections to lab 1 before moving on to lab 2!!!

You will log into your repl.it account, fork your lab 1 Repl.it to create a Repl.it for lab two. Copy index and rename it lab 1. Create a new page for lab 2. Then you will write code to turn index.html into the main page of a labs portfolio. Add navigation hyperlinks so the user can surf to all lab pages and back to index. The navigation should be on every page. Put the instructions for lab 1 on the lab 1 page along with your code for lab 1. Put the instructions for lab 2 on the lab 2 page. Remember all text needs to be in a tag. On the index page add some text saying welcome to your CPSC 2125 Labs 1-6 portfolio. You will fork and add to this for labs 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

To submit your work, get the shareable link (use the invite button to generate a join link) and paste it into the submission box in CougarView.

Grading checklist:

corrections to previous labs
index page that is the welcome page for your CPSC 2125 labs 1-6 portfolio
lab 1 page has HTML you wrote for lab 1 and the lab 1 instructions
lab 2 page has instructions for lab 2
All three pages have a navigation bar (list of navigation links) that lets you get to the other two pages
All text is contained in a tag (no stray text), all tags are closed; remember the DOM!

Don't copy pasta!!! If you get code from somewhere you must include comments about where it came from, how it works, and any modifications you made!!!</p>
